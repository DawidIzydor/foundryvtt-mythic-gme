**CUSTOMIZATION** - Macros use Roll Tables! Going to **Module Settings** lets you choose which tables are being used and can be configured. Table names must begin with **Mythic** in order to be eligible (this is to avoid dropdown crowding).

**WARNING** - If you installed pre-release builds from manifest links, please uninstall and reinstall the module from Foundry! Important scripts have changed since.
